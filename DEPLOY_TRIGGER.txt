CRITICAL MIGRATION FIX:

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED via diagnostic endpoint:
- Only 3/6 migrations executed in Render
- Missing migrations: 20251007120002, 20251007120003, 20251007120004
- Column 'status' does NOT exist in attendances table (causing 500 errors)
- Columns missing in users and departments tables

FIX APPLIED:
- Moved npm run db:migrate from buildCommand to startCommand
- Migrations will now run EVERY time server starts
- This deploy will execute the 3 missing migrations

Expected after this deploy:
✅ status column added to attendances
✅ All user columns added (phone, departmentId, can_use_mobile_app, etc.)
✅ All department columns added (description, address, gps_lat, etc.)
✅ ALL endpoints should work (no more 500 errors)
